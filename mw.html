    <h4>User Interviews</h4>
    <p>
      We conducted 5 interviews with prospective business owners, to understand
      how to increase retention with new vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research Question: How can we improve the vendors experience for selling
      products online so they can increase their revenue?
    </p>
    <p>These were the main takeaways from our user interviews:</p>
    <p>
      Users were intimidated by setting up delivery services and felt
      discouraged selling online because of processing fees and the time and
      expenses it takes to build a website
    </p>
    <p>
      Users found that social media was an easy and accessible starting point to
      start selling online and allowed users to reach a wider audience that is
      not reliant on foot traffic
